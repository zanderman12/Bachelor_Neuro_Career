# What does the application process look like?

There are lots of guides out there on what applying for a PhD is like, each a little different. Rather than reinvent the wheel, I will just link to some of my favorites:

- The first one is from Lucy Lai and walks through the entire application process, including what interviews are like, with example documents: [All About PhD Applications](https://lucy-lai.com/blog/gradapps)

- A second option is a crowdsourced guide that contains a lot of examples of the different documents you will need to produce as part of the process: [Grad School Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7dROc2yMAX0nKl1V0qu1I_3JaLnJurn54UwBDyHFB4/edit#heading=h.8enfkrpxuxer)

- Some other guides to look at:
    - [PhD Admissions Advice. Sorry about the hidden curriculum.](https://cfiesler.medium.com/phd-admissions-advice-b7a44f97417a)
    - [How to apply for Graduate Student Positions](https://sites.google.com/view/apply-academic-positions/graduate-student)

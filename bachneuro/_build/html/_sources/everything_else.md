# Science Adjacent Careers
```{contents}
```
So you don’t want to be a doctor or researcher, great! There are still lots of things you can do as a career that uses your neuroscience degree!  Below is an incomplete list of options with descriptions. As with most of this guide, it is not comprehensive and you should view it only as a starting point. Most of the roles I list below I think of as “Research Adjacent”. They are not roles where you will be doing the hands-on, day-to-day of conducting research studies, but they are vital for the production and dissemination of scientific innovations.

## Technical Writing
Ever wonder who creates those drug brochures you get at doctor’s offices? What about the sales pamphlets? Or the instructions for that knee brace you just bought? There is a massive industry around writing technical documents. These require the writer to have an understanding of the material, even if they did not do the research. This can take the form of an editor at a scientific journal or for a textbook company as well. Really if you think about all the scientific writing that exists in the world, someone had to write it, and often, it is not the person who did the research.

If this sounds like it would be interesting to you, look for jobs titled “technical writer” or “technical editor”. If you are looking for companies, look at the big pharmaceuticals. Abbvie and Pfizer are always looking for more technical writers.

## Science journalism
Whether freelance or under contract, science journalism can be an extremely rewarding career as you translate the technical reports and scientific publications into a format that is digestible for a mass audience. You will get to talk with brilliant people who are passionate about their work and will have an opportunity to continue to learn.  That is not to say it is all sunshine and rainbows, but for the right person, this is an incredibly rewarding career. 

American Association for the Advancement of Science offers a 10 week summer fellowship that is worth checking out if you are interested: AAAS Mass Media Science & Engineering Fellowship

Beyond that, I recommend you just start doing science journalism on the side. We live in a golden age where anyone can write a blog. Just start yours and share it with everyone you can think of. You will be amazed at how far good work will spread.

## Technical Sales
Similar to the Technical Writing role, there is an entire industry around selling these marvelous scientific advances. While this often takes the role of a drug rep, it does not have to. Medical Device Companies (say Stryker) will have these roles. As will many smaller companies and startups. When I worked for Halo Neuroscience (a small neurotech startup), we hired Neuroscience majors to work with both our sales and marketing teams. You have to understand the science enough to sell whatever the product is to people who also understand the science. Your training in neuroscience will set you apart here from those without that background.

## Medical Device Support
Going beyond sales, there are lots of roles that support the production of medical devices and drugs. Quality assurance (where you test the product and produce the appropriate documentation) and people managers are vital for the industry. Once you have worked for a couple of different people you will realize the difference a good manager makes. Similarly, the is always a need for support of the research process (I am indebted to people on my research team who covered everything from the finances to scheduling participants, to organizing and managing the lab supplies). It is necessary work that some people find very fulfilling.

## Non-Profit Manager
There are large non-profit organizations that are vital to the research process. Organizations like the Society for Neuroscience or the National Science Foundation provide opportunities to share scientific work, organize conferences, and provide funding for research to take place. All of that requires people to organize and lead and creates a wide range of career opportunities for those wishing to stay involved in science even if they are not doing research.

## Broader Options
Finally, the simple truth is that many undergraduates do not end up working in the field their degree is in. As a college graduate, especially in a STEM field, you will have many options in the world of consulting, teaching, sales, marketing, customer support, data science, and more. Maybe your knowledge of chemistry will allow you to pivot to a food scientist. Or maybe you have a love of teaching and will get a master's in education to become a high school teacher? All of these options are worth their own document so I won’t go into too many details here, but I recommend you do some googling and talk to your career advisor to find out more.

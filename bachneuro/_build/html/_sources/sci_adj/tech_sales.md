# Technical Sales
Similar to the Technical Writing role, there is an entire industry around selling these marvelous scientific advances. While this often takes the role of a drug rep, it does not have to. Medical Device Companies (such as Stryker) will have these roles. As will many smaller companies and startups. When I worked for Halo Neuroscience (a small neurotech startup), we hired Neuroscience majors to work with both our sales and marketing teams. You have to understand the science enough to sell whatever the product is to people who also understand the science. Your training in neuroscience will set you apart here from those without that background.

# Medical Device Support
Going beyond sales, there are lots of roles that support the production of medical devices and drugs. Quality assurance (where you test the product and produce the appropriate documentation) and people managers are vital for the industry. Once you have worked for a couple of different people you will realize the difference a good manager makes. Similarly, there is always a need for support of the research process (I am indebted to people on my research team who covered the finances, scheduling participants, or organizing and managing the lab supplies). It is necessary work that some people find very fulfilling.

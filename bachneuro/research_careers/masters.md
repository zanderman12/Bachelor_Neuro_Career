# Masters Programs
There are master's programs in neuroscience that you can do. In general, though, I do not recommend these. Typically, you will have to pay for a master's program (rather than being paid through a stipend for a Ph.D.) and often you will still need to go get a Ph.D. afterward to achieve the same academic standing (sucks but academia is not fair).  

There are rare instances where a master's degree may make sense. Most commonly this would be if you are completing the masters on the side while working full time. In these instances, the company you are working for may pay for all or part of the master’s degree in exchange for a guarantee that you will continue working at the company for some amount of time. This can be a great way to expand your skills without sacrificing other professional or economic opportunities.

All of that said, I generally would steer clear of a master’s program and focus on the other options.

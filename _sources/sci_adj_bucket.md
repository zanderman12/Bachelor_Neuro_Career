# Science Adjacent Careers:

Most students end up doing something besides research or medical school and so most will be captured by this miscellaneous bucket. What that is will depend on you. I know of neuroscience majors that are now in sales (see technical sales for information about how to use your degree in a sales role), marketing (again can still lean on your neuroscience knowledge), technical writing/editing, grant work, consulting, teaching (non-college level) and everything else. If you are graduating but donâ€™t want to end up a doctor or doing research but still love science, check out the [Science Adjacent Careers](everything_else.md) page. Note: I also touch upon non-science careers here.

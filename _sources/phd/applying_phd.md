# Applying for a Ph.D.

So you want to apply for a Ph.D.? A Ph.D. is a great undertaking that typically lasts 4-7 years and is honestly a blast if you get it right. There are a lot of great resources out there about how to apply for a Ph.D., what the process looks like, and every step along the way, so I will largely link to those below rather than reinvent the wheel. That said, I want to call out a couple of really specific pieces of advice of my own.

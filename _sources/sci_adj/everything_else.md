# Science Adjacent Careers

So you don’t want to be a doctor or researcher, great! There are still lots of things you can do as a career that uses your neuroscience degree!  Below is an incomplete list of options with descriptions. As with most of this guide, it is not comprehensive and you should view it only as a starting point. Most of the roles I list below I think of as “Research Adjacent”. They are not roles where you will be doing the hands-on, day-to-day of conducting research studies, but they are vital for the production and dissemination of scientific innovations.

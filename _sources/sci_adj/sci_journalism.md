# Science journalism
Whether freelance or under contract, science journalism can be an extremely rewarding career as you translate the technical reports and scientific publications into a format that is digestible for a mass audience. You will get to talk with brilliant people who are passionate about their work and will have an opportunity to continue to learn.  That is not to say it is all sunshine and rainbows, but for the right person, this is an incredibly rewarding career. 

American Association for the Advancement of Science offers a 10-week summer fellowship that is worth checking out if you are interested: [AAAS Mass Media Science & Engineering Fellowship](https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship)

Beyond that, I recommend you just start doing science journalism on the side. We live in a golden age where anyone can write a blog. Just start yours and share it with everyone you can think of. You will be amazed at how far good work will spread.

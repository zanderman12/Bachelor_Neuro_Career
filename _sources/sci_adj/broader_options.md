# Broader Options
Finally, the simple truth is that many undergraduates do not end up working in the field their degree is in. As a college graduate, especially in a STEM field, you will have many options in the world of consulting, teaching, sales, marketing, customer support, data science, and more. Maybe your knowledge of chemistry will allow you to pivot to a food scientist. Or maybe you have a love of teaching and will get a master's in education to become a high school teacher? All of these options are worth their own document so I wonâ€™t go into too many details here, but I recommend you do some googling and talk to your career advisor to find out more.

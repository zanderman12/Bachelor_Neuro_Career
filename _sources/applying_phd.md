# Applying for a Ph.D.
```{contents}
```

So you want to apply for a Ph.D.? A Ph.D. is a great undertaking that typically lasts 4-7 years and is honestly a blast if you get it right. There are a lot of great resources out there about how to apply for a Ph.D., what the process looks like, and every step along the way, so I will largely link to those below rather than reinvent the wheel. That said, I want to call out a couple of really specific pieces of advice of my own.

## First things first: What is a Ph.D.
A Ph.D. is a graduate degree where you study something and try to create new knowledge. The best explanation I have seen of what this looks like is from Matt Might: The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D. (might.net).
What does the application process look like?

There are lots of guides out there, each a little different. Rather than reinvent the wheel, I will just link to some of my favorites:

The first one is from Lucy Lai and walks through the entire application process with example documents: All About PhD Applications | lucy lai (lucy-lai.com)

A second option is a crowdsourced guide that contains a lot of examples of the different documents you will need to produce as part of the process: Grad School Resources - Google Docs

## How Much Does a PhD Cost?
One of the most common questions is one of the biggest misconceptions out there and is something that I did not realize when I was an undergraduate. You should be getting paid to do a Ph.D. 

Any neuroscience Ph.D. program worth its salt will cover both your tuition and provide you with a stipend for your graduate career. Will you get paid a lot of money? No (My yearly salary was cut in half when I went from working in industry to starting my Ph.D.), but it should be enough to live on. If you are looking at a program that will not provide you with a stipend, stop and look elsewhere.

For a comparison of how much you can expect to get paid, check out: Results - PhD Stipends. It is crowdsourced and self-reported, so take everything with a grain of salt, but it can provide a ballpark reference.

### Application fees
Now, while you should be paid for the Ph.D., the application often has a fee associated with it (often $75+ per application). If this is not a concern for you, great! If it is, you should know that you can get this fee waived in most cases. 

Some programs and foundations try to promote graduate students of specific backgrounds or to specific schools and will cover or waive the application fee
Grad App Aid — Queer in AI
FreeApp Eligibility | Big Ten Academic Alliance (btaa.org)
Many programs will provide a free waiver code just by asking for one. This is a regret of mine and I probably could have saved some money by just emailing the program advisor and asking to have the application fee waived.

## Recommendation letters
Recommendation letters are an important part of applications. Check out the recommendation letters section for tips on how to maximize yours.

## What can you do now to prepare for a Ph.D. application/program?
You may be convinced that a Ph.D. is for you, you may be exploring your options, or you may just want to keep as many doors open as you can. Below are some of my thoughts on what you can do now. For someone else’s thoughts, this article provides some solid advice for Neuro programs even though it is written with computer science in mind: What you Can do in College to get into a CS PhD Program (utah.edu)

### Take the GRE while you are still in college.
The GRE is to graduate school what the SAT is to undergraduate. It is a general knowledge test that is meant to try to predict how successful you will be as a grad student. There are also subject-specific versions of the GRE (for instance GRE Psychology) which grad programs may ask for.  Also similar to the SAT, The GRE has all the baggage and calls for reform and is by no means a good metric to predict graduate school success. While many programs are starting not to require the GRE, I still think it is worth taking, the worst thing that happens is you don’t report your score.

Now why do I say you should take it now (in college) rather than after (say right before you apply) when earlier I recommended you take a couple of years in between college and grad school? First, any score on the GRE is valid for 5 years, meaning if you get a good score now you can bank it for the future. Second, You right now are an expert test taker. You have been taking tests regularly for the last 15 years. The moment you walk out of college, those tests will stop and everything will leave your head. It will be twice as hard to study and three times as hard to actually take a test again. Far easier to bank the score now, especially since you can now take the GRE online from the comfort of your own home.

### Try to get involved in research
A Ph.D. at its core is a research training degree. Therefore anything you can do to demonstrate both an interest and initial training in research will be beneficial. What if it's not related to your actual research interests? Doesn’t matter. What if it's really small or part-time? Doesn’t matter. The important part is demonstrating that you have interest in doing research.

My first exposure to research was helping an undergraduate senior collect data for their senior thesis. I would sit in a room, read the IRB consent form to participants, and then sit them in front of a computer for the experiment (the computer explained the actual experiment). I then waited for 30 min for the computer to finish. I would then tell the participant the entire premise was a lie, get the senior, and let them finish the experiment. I had no hand in the design, analysis, or presentation of the experiment. And yet I ended up talking about this experience during my graduate interviews. It mattered.

### Email and Talk to Potential Advisors
This is more for when you get closer to submitting your application, but I highly recommend you email and try to have a phone call with potential advisors. Some will respond while others won't, but your goal is to try to answer 2 questions. 

First, does this person seem like someone you want to work for? You will be tied to your advisor at the hip for the next 6 years of your life and your advisor will be your go to reference for the rest of your career. If you doubt me, check out sites like The Academic Family Tree (academictree.org) and see if you can look up your professors. You can trace the lineage of advisors back a hundred years. You want to choose someone who will be a good mentor and who you get along with. 70+% of your grad school decision should come down to the advisor, not the school or the research project.

Second, does this advisor actually have room/funding in their lab for you? Graduate advisors often are limited in how many PhD students they can support (remember you are getting paid) and there will be times when they just are not able to take a student. The last thing you want to do is to end up at a school because of one advisor and not be able to join their lab. So ask, they will tell you.

## Look for PhD Advisors that are actively recruiting Graduate Students
Some advisors will advertise that they are recruiting students by posting on social media and various list servs. These can be a great way to get an idea of who potential advisors could be as well as get a sense for what type of research is out there.  Similar to the passive job search described below, this can be a great way to gain exposure to different projects and help figure out what you are truly interested in.

Society listservs are great for these

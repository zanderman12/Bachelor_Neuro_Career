# Research Careers:
Many undergraduates are interested in a career in research, doing experiments, and discovering things. This can take many different forms from doing benchwork/wet work with cells or animals to running clinical trials with human patients. You can also focus on data analysis as a data scientist. Research projects can take place in academia (working at a college or university) or in industry (working for a company/non-profit).

If this is you, check out the [research careers](research_careers.md) page. 

Similarly, if you think you want to become a college professor with a focus on teaching rather than research, then check out the  [research careers](research_careers.md) page. While the end goal is different the initial path there will be similar and you will be making similar decisions right out of undergrad.

<p>So you want to do research. Thats great! Research is an exciting career of staring into the unknown and planting a flag that says this is how the world is and here is the data to prove it. From a practical standpoint, upon graduating with an undergraduate degree there are a couple of obvious next steps to consider:</p>
<section id="working-in-an-academic-lab">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" role="doc-backlink">Working in an Academic Lab</a><a class="headerlink" href="#working-in-an-academic-lab" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>These positions are a great way to gain some research experience and to gain exposure to what life working in a research lab at a university looks like. They typically hold titles like “Lab Manager”, “Research Assistant”, or “Research Technician”. In all cases you will be an assistant to the lab, helping with data collection and cleaning, reviewing manuscripts and grants, and generally helping the PI (principal investigator, who is in charge of the lab and your boss) with their research. These are great positions that sometimes lead to having your name on publications and generally create a firm foundation for an eventual Ph.D.</p>
<p>On the note of Ph.D., these positions will normally include you interacting with Ph.D. students, giving you a first-hand look at what life as a Ph.D. student is and what the process of completing a Ph.D. looks like. While normally not directly stated, the expectation with most of these positions is that you will work in the lab for 1-3 years before applying for PhD programs. Your PI and other graduate students in the lab will also help you with your application and can act as references for your application.</p>
<p>These positions often get posted on job boards but it can also be worthwhile emailing a PI directly to ask if there are any openings if they or their research is particularly interesting to you. (check out <a class="reference internal" href="applying_phd.html"><span class="std std-doc">emailing potential advisors</span></a> for some ideas of what to include in your email). You can also look at a large R1’s job listings, for local positions (say UofC, Northwestern, UIC, etc for around Chicago). That said, some job boards to look at include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Psychology Job Wiki 2023-2024: Predocs - Psych Wiki 2023-2024 (<a class="reference external" href="http://wikidot.com">wikidot.com</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities | Pathways to Research and Doctoral Careers (<a class="reference external" href="http://predoc.org">predoc.org</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>These are also sometimes posted on <a class="reference internal" href="general_tips.html"><span class="std std-doc">society listservs</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>These positions will also sometimes get posted on general job boards like Indeed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you think that a PhD is in your future, do check out the applying for a PhD program section as there are some practical things you can do now to prepare for an eventual application.</p>
</section>
<section id="working-in-an-industry-lab">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" role="doc-backlink">Working in an Industry Lab</a><a class="headerlink" href="#working-in-an-industry-lab" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While not as common, there is a growing neuroscience industry making it a great time to explore working in industry. Here you will work for a company (such as a pharmaceutical company or a small startup) doing the same sort of research you would be doing at an academic lab, though with a slight difference in goals (making/proving a product vs discovering new knowledge). You will likely be more focused on the data collection and cleaning, with any writing coming in the form of grants or technical internal reports. If you got to a smaller company/startup, you may also interact directly with customers or help create scientifically accurate marketing materials.</p>
<p>These positions typically have similar titles to the academic lab but are just working for a company rather than a university.</p>
<p>Industry lab positions can still be a great stepping stone for PhD programs but they don’t have to be. There are often promotion paths through industry that may allow for a career in research without a graduate degree. My understanding is that the PhD path is actually shorter, allowing you to skip ranks in the industry world, but you will be making significantly more money along the way by staying in industry so whichever path you take will depend on you.</p>
<p>One final note is that, unlike an academic lab, many industry lab positions do not have the same timeline expectations and may not provide the same support and time to prepare graduate school applications. This does not mean they are a bad option (I worked for 3 years in industry before starting my Ph.D. and I loved it), but know that you will have to be self-motivated to get the graduate school applications done because the expectations and norms are not the same.  If you think that a PhD is in your future, do check out the applying for a PhD program section as there are some practical things you can do now.</p>
</section>
<section id="post-baccalaureate-programs">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" role="doc-backlink">Post Baccalaureate programs</a><a class="headerlink" href="#post-baccalaureate-programs" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>One alternative to getting a job is to apply for a post-bac program. These are meant as 1-2-year programs between completing your undergraduate career and starting a PhD. For all intents and purposes, these are very similar to working in an academic lab but also include coursework to round out your education and to provide some professional development. The expectation is that you apply for PhD programs during the program and they will help guide you through the process. These are great opportunities if the fit is right and worth checking out if you think a PhD is in your future.  They are also a great way to gain some research training if you have not had the opportunity to participate in research during your undergraduate career.</p>
<p>One important note is that these post-bac programs are meant as fellowships, meaning they supply a stipend (salary) for you to live off of. Some may provide housing as well (though this is less common). You do not need to pay for these (though there is an opportunity cost as both academic and industry lab positions will typically pay more).</p>
<p>Some example post-bac programs include, but there are many more:
Postbaccalaureate Program: Northwestern University Interdepartmental Neuroscience: Feinberg School of Medicine
PiNBAC
Post-baccalaureate Programs | Office of Neuroscience Research | Washington University in St. Louis (<a class="reference external" href="http://wustl.edu">wustl.edu</a>)

Indiana Univeristy
Notre Dame
Ohio State
University of Cincinnati
Kansas
Louisville
Purdue
Case Western
Wisconsin

Ph.D. Programs
Many students that I talk to ask about going straight into PhD programs.  While this is possible, it is actually a lot rarer than many think. For instance in my PhD cohort of ~15 students, there was only 1 person who went straight from undergraduate to the PhD program. Most worked in an academic or industry lab for a couple of years first.</p>
<p>On top of that, I do not recommend students go straight from undergraduate to a PhD program.</p>
<p>A couple of reasons. First, I often find that students who want to go straight aren’t going into the Ph.D. with a purpose and instead view it as the default option. I want to be clear that this is not the case. Sometimes students are afraid of entering the “real world” and view the idea of staying a student as a safe path. While this may be true, it also is just delaying the inevitable and you should just rip the bandaid off and face the real world (it’s not as scary as it seems). Sometimes students feel that they are not prepared for the job they want and view a Ph.D. as the necessary training. This is also not true, you will gain better training working and gaining real world experience than in the classroom. Finally, in my experience, many of the Ph.D. students who went straight from undergrad really struggled as grad students. These students often get burnt out and end up hating their dissertation. Often times they leave research entirely when they are done. While there is nothing wrong with leaving research after your Ph.D., you can save yourself a lot of pain and suffering by just exploring the real world first.</p>
<p>All of that said, if you are convinced a Ph.D. is for you, or if you want to look at what the application process is like, continue to the applying for a PhD Section.</p>
<p>Finally, I will note my own bias here. I applied for phd programs as a senior undergraduate student and did not get into any of the programs I applied to. I then worked for 3 years before applying again and this time did get into multiple programs including some that rejected me the first time. When I look back on the first round of applications, I agree with the programs that rejected me, I was not ready and would not have done well. The second time I was ready and thrived.</p>

<p>There are master’s programs in neuroscience that you can do. In general, though, I do not recommend these. Typically, you will have to pay for a master’s program (rather than being paid through a stipend for a Ph.D.) and often you will still need to go get a Ph.D. afterward to achieve the same academic standing (sucks but academia is not fair).</p>
<p>There are rare instances where a master’s degree may make sense. Most commonly this would be if you are completing the masters on the side while working full time. In these instances, the company you are working for pay for all or part of the master’s degree in exchange for a guarantee that you will continue working at the company for some amount of time. This can be a great way to expand your skills without sacrificing other professional or economic opportunities.</p>
<p>All of that said, I generally would steer clear of a master’s program and focus on the other options above.</p>
